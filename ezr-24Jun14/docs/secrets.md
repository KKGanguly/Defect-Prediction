Lotfi A. Zadeh â€” 'As complexity rises, precise statements lose meaning and meaningful statements lose precision'

N hwhere is this more true that int he statisical analysis of exmprial outputs.
have to checkle when people report teh result as 0.6913 when theor stamdard devoatopms are 0.2
(so the "precision" of those five significant figures is somewhat spurious).

Lets respect what 

- espsiolon effects
- Not quite All Roads lead to Roam bu
- most Roads lead to similar places

    not seeking the ebst, seek things taht are d=indistinguishabe from best lesson of $\spilon$-domiantiom: once you get close enough, there is little
    to be gained by going closer.

-- most data is reduncat, irrelvant
   - feature selection: i often find $\sqrt{n}$ attributes are enough
   - isnreance selection: 10% enough
   - so a table of data with 100 columns and 10,000 rows has ony 10*1000=$10^4$ improtant
     cells, whush is about 1% ofthe roignal numebr of cells.
